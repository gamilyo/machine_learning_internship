The goal of this task is to classify between the spk_1 and spk_2

The final output should be "0" for spk_1 and "1" for spk_2

Data is organized as follows
============================

data
├── test
│   ├── spk_1
│   └── spk_2
└── train
    ├── spk_1
    └── spk_2

=> the train directory contains about an hour. Each class is half an hour per class

=> the test  directory contains about  10 wav files per each class


Hint:
=====
You can use the internet 
The wifi name is "guests" and the password is "Rdi@2020$$"

you can use the library 'librosa'
1- read the wav files, use "librosa.load"
2- extract MFCC features, use "librosa.feature.mfcc"

note that MFCC is a 2D dimensional features
